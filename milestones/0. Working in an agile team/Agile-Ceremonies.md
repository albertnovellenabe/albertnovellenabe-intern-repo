# Agile Ceremonies & Collaboration Reflection

## Reflection

### Communication and Alignment

Agile ceremonies act as a "sanity check." Without the Daily Stand-up, I might spend three days over-engineering a PostgreSQL query that the team doesn't actually need. These meetings force us to stop, look at the big picture, and ensure we're all building the same product.

### The Most Important Ceremony for Me

For my role, **Sprint Planning** is the most critical. Because I am balancing my 4th-year studies with this internship, I need to be 100% sure that my "sprint commitment" is realistic. If I don't participate actively in planning, I risk over-committing and burning out during exam weeks.

### 1. Stand-up Observation

I attended today's stand-up and noticed that the best updates were the most concise ones. When someone mentioned a blocker, the team didn't try to solve it right there; they scheduled a "parking lot" chat for later. This kept the meeting under 15 minutes and respected everyone's time.

### 2. Retrospective Insight

I reviewed the notes from the last retrospective. The team decided to implement a "No-Meeting Wednesday" to allow for deep work. This is a huge win for me, as it gives me a solid block of time to focus on complex Kotlin features without interruption.

### 3. One Change for Better Collaboration

**The Action:** I will start adding "Contextual Comments" to my tickets.
**The Goal:** Instead of just moving a ticket to "In Progress," I will leave a brief comment on my current approach. This helps asynchronous teammates see my logic without needing to ping me for a status update while I'm in class.
