# Kanban Workflow & Productivity Reflection

## Reflection

### Managing Priorities & Overload
Kanban is a reality check. When I see five cards in my "In Progress" column, I realize why I feel stressed—I'm trying to do too much at once. By using WIP limits, I can give my full focus to one PostgreSQL query or one Jetpack Compose screen at a time, which actually makes me faster in the long run.

### Improving My Workflow
I plan to apply the "Pull System." Instead of a supervisor pushing tasks on me, I’ll pull the highest-priority item from the To-Do column whenever I have a free block of time between my USC classes. This keeps me proactive without feeling overwhelmed.

### 1. Repo Kanban Setup
I have set up a Kanban board in my GitHub/Jira repo with the following columns:
* **Backlog:** Future features (e.g., "Add MQTT support").
* **To Do:** Immediate tasks for this week.
* **In Progress:** What I'm coding right now.
* **Review/QA:** Tasks waiting for a teammate's eyes or the Focus Bear bot.
* **Done:** Completed and merged code.

### 2. The Flow in Action
* **Task:** Implement Secure OTP logic.
* **Movement:** I moved this from **To Do** to **In Progress** when I started the session, and eventually to **Review** after my unit tests passed. Updating the status in real-time helped me stay focused on the specific goal of the session.

### 3. Improving Task Tracking
**The Change:** I will start adding "Blocker" labels to cards with a brief note on *why* they are stuck.
**The Goal:** If I'm waiting on a library update or a supervisor's approval, the board will show exactly what we're waiting for. This prevents tasks from just "sitting" in In Progress without any explanation.
