# Terminal Setup & Command Line Reflection

### 1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose **GNOME Terminal**, the default for Fedora. I prefer it because it is native to my desktop environment, lightweight, and handles transparency and color schemes beautifully. I also occasionally use the **integrated terminal in VS Code** to keep my terminal and code editor in a single view, which speeds up my development cycle.

### 2. What customizations (if any) did you make?
I customized my setup to improve productivity and visibility:
- **Bash Profile:** I am using the default Bash shell, but I've explored adding aliases to simplify long commands.
- **Visuals:** I adjusted the color palette to a "Dark" theme to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.
- **Git Integration:** I enabled a credential helper (`credential.helper store`) to manage my GitHub Personal Access Tokens securely within the terminal environment.

### 3. What was the most useful command you learned today?
The most useful command I learned today was `git remote add origin [URL]`. 
I previously had files in a local folder that weren't connected to a repository. Learning how to initialize a repository (`git init`) and manually link it to a remote GitHub URL was crucial for syncing my local internship work with the cloud. I also found `git status` invaluable for tracking which files were staged or untracked during the setup process.
