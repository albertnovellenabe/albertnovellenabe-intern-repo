# AI Tools in Development: Reflection

### 1. Which AI tools did you try?
For this assignment, I utilized a multi-tool approach:
- **Gemini:** Used as a conversational assistant to debug complex terminal errors (like the Git authentication "Invalid username or token" error) and to plan the structure of my documentation.

### 2. What worked well? What didn’t?
- **What worked well:** AI is incredibly efficient at solving "bottleneck" errors. For example, when my Git push failed due to the transition from passwords to Personal Access Tokens, the AI provided a step-by-step fix faster than a manual search. It also excelled at generating the Markdown structure for these assignments.
- **What didn’t work:** Inline suggestions (Copilot) can sometimes be "noisy" when writing highly specific logic, suggesting code that doesn't quite match the intended architecture. I found that I still need to review every line to ensure it follows the project's specific needs.

### 3. When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
AI is most useful in three specific scenarios:
1. **Unblocking Errors:** Quickly interpreting cryptic terminal or compiler errors.
2. **Boilerplate & Scaffolding:** Generating repetitive code like Markdown templates, basic HTML structures, or CRUD operations.
3. **Learning New Concepts:** Explaining how a new tool (like a Git Credential Helper) works in plain language before I implement it.
