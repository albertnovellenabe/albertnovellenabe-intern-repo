### 3. Why do you think this mission is important?

The mission is important since it helps people achieve their full potential.

I value tools the provide tangible improvements to the user.

### 5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes. I am doing 3 huge projects at the same time including the OJT, and I have to say, I have already mastered the art of doing everything simultaneously and still making it work. Focusing on a single minor task may seem impossible. Focus Bear can help me by maybe slowly re-adapting to my old self.
