# Internship Reflection & Goals

### 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to learn how to transition from building solo projects to working within a professional, scalable codebase. Specifically, I want to understand the industry-standard workflows for code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and how to maintain high-quality documentation in a collaborative environment.

### 2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am excited to deepen my expertise in mobile-backend architecture. Having worked with Kotlin (Jetpack Compose) and Express.js, I want to learn how to optimize real-time data flow in a production setting. I’m also eager to improve my ability to write clean, testable code that follows professional architectural patterns.

### 3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I bring a strong foundation in full-stack development and a "builder" mindset. I am comfortable working across the stack, from Android (Kotlin) to backend services (Node.js/GraphQL). My experience with database management and real-time data allows me to contribute effectively to features involving system monitoring and user authentication.

### 4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I feel less confident in system testing and DevOps. While I can build functional features, I want to get better at writing comprehensive Unit and Integration tests to ensure long-term system stability. I also want to learn more about cloud deployment and infrastructure management.

### 5. What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success means shipping features that provide real value to the project and its users. By the end of this internship, I want to have contributed to the core module of the application, improved my technical communication skills, and produced high-quality code that follows the team's standards.
