# Agile Roles & Collaboration Reflection

## Reflection

### My Role in the Process
My primary role is as a **Developer**. In the Agile process, I contribute by breaking down technical tasks (like setting up GraphQL resolvers) into manageable pieces and providing realistic estimates on how long they will take. I also act as a "Technical Entrepreneur," suggesting ways to simplify code to deliver value to the user faster.

### Interacting with Other Roles
My work overlaps heavily with **QA** and **Product Management**. 
* With the **PM**, I discuss if a feature is technically feasible within our stack. 
* With **QA**, I provide unit tests and documentation so they know exactly what my code is supposed to do, which reduces the "back-and-forth" during bug fixing.

### 1. My Role Fit
I am a **Technical Intern/Developer**. My job is to take the "User Stories" from our backlog and turn them into functional features using Kotlin and Express.js. I fit into the Agile team by being transparent about my progress on the Kanban board and by proactively flagging blockers (like a database connection issue) before they stall the entire sprint.

### 2. Frequent Collaboration
**Role:** Quality Assurance (QA) / Peer Reviewers.
**How to Improve:** I can improve teamwork by practicing **"Defensive Coding"**—writing my own tests and documenting my logic in pull requests before I even ask for a review. By making it easier for the QA/Reviewer to understand my work, I help the whole team maintain a faster "Velocity" (speed of delivery).

## Verification
I understand that while my title is "Developer," I am part of a larger ecosystem. I commit to communicating clearly with all roles to ensure we ship high-quality software that actually solves user problems.
