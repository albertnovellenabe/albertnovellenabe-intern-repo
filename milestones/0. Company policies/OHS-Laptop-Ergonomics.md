# My Workspace Level-Up: Ergonomics Edition

## Reflection

### Equipment Changes
* **Current Situation:** I've mostly been working with my laptop flat on the desk, which makes me lean forward and strain my neck to see the code.
* **The Fix:** I’m going to start using a laptop stand to get the screen to eye level. If I'm on a budget, I'll use a stack of my thickest textbooks for now.

### Behavioural Changes
* **The Goal:** Stop "turtling" (poking my chin out toward the screen). 
* **The Habit:** I'll focus on keeping my feet flat on the floor instead of crossing my legs, which usually messes up my hip alignment.

### Staying Consistent
* **The Plan:** Since I get "in the zone" and forget time exists, I'll use **Focus Bear** to force me to take a 2-minute movement break every hour. No excuses.

## ask Documentation

### 1. Setup Adjustments
* Raised the laptop so I'm looking straight ahead, not down.
* Cleared off my desk space so my mouse arm isn't cramped against the edge.

### 2. The One Upgrade
* **Item:** A dedicated external keyboard and mouse.
* **Why:** This is the only way to keep the screen high while keeping my hands in a comfortable, low position.

### 3. How it Felt (Full Day Test)
* **Date:** February 16, 2026
* **The Verdict:** Taking the scheduled Focus Bear breaks actually made me *more* productive. I didn't hit that 3 PM wall where my neck usually starts burning.

### 4. Final Habit Change
* I’ve committed to the 20-20-20 rule for eye strain. It’s a small change, but my eyes feel way less "grainy" by the end of the night.
