My Role
I am working on:

Final year BS Entrepreneurship projects and my internship at Focus Bear.

Developing Android features using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Backend logic with Express.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.

Building out real-time monitoring and location-tracking systems.

The days and times I work are:

Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

Working With Me
For our first meeting:

I value a clear starting point. If we have a brief, I’ll have read it—I appreciate it if you have, too.

I’m a fan of jumping straight into the "how" and "why" of the tech we’re building.

For regular meetings:

Agenda first: I work best when I know exactly what we need to solve before the call starts.

Note-taking: I usually take notes to keep my tasks organized. If I'm quiet, I'm likely documenting an action item or a logic flow.

Technical Depth: I love digging into the nuances of the stack. If you have a better way to handle a refresh token or a database query, please tell me.

Communication Channels
Email: Use this for things that don't need an answer today.

Discord: My primary spot for "during the day" talk. If I’m in a deep work session, I might not reply instantly, but I’ll get back to you within a few hours.

SMS/Call: Use this only if something is genuinely broken or a deadline is minutes away.

How I Work Best
I do my best work when:

I have a solid block of "Deep Work" time to focus on complex logic without pings.

Requirements are clear. I like knowing the "why" behind a feature so I can build it better.

I can collaborate on architectural decisions but then execute them independently.

I struggle when:

Context-switching happens too often. It’s hard to jump from a database schema to a marketing meeting and back again.

Instructions are vague. "Make it look better" is hard for me; "Align these elements and use this hex code" is perfect.

Communication Style
Direct and Honest: You don't need to sugarcoat feedback. If my code could be cleaner, just tell me how.

Research-Backed: If I run into a bug, I’ll usually spend 30 minutes trying to kill it myself before I ask for help. I appreciate the same from others.

Asynchronous: I prefer reading a detailed message I can reply to when I have a break in my logic.

Collaboration & Teamwork
My Pet Peeve: Circular conversations. If we've decided on a path, I want to start building it immediately.

Meetings: I’m a fan of "Standing Meetings"—keep them short, focused, and actionable.

Support: I’m always happy to help a teammate debug something, especially if it involves Kotlin or SQL. Just give me a heads-up so I can find a stopping point in my own work.

Fun Facts & Quirks
The "Processing" Face: If I’m staring blankly at my screen during a meeting, I’m not bored—I’m mentally compiling the code or the logic we’re discussing.

Entrepreneurial Mindset: Because of my degree, I’m always thinking about the "business value" of a feature, not just the code.

Superpower: I can usually spot a missing comma or a logic flaw in a PostgreSQL query from a mile away.
