# Inclusive Design & Working with Vulnerable Populations

## Reflection

### Adapting My Communication
I realize that being "vague" is an accessibility barrier. To be more inclusive, I will focus on being explicit in my pull requests and messages. Instead of assuming context is understood, I’ll provide clear "before and after" summaries and specific action items for my teammates.

### UX & Communication Pitfalls
A major pitfall is "feature creep"—adding too many bells and whistles that end up cluttering the UI. For someone with ADHD, every extra icon is a potential distraction. Another issue is using high-pressure language like "You are falling behind!" which can trigger shame and shut down productivity rather than encouraging it.

### One Practical Change
I will prioritize "Dark Mode" and high-contrast accessibility in the UI components I build. I'll also ensure that any real-time alerts I code (like in the monitoring app) are meaningful and don't fire off unnecessary notifications that contribute to noise.

### 1. Research Insight
I looked into how people with ADHD interact with productivity apps. A common complaint is "notification fatigue." Users often end up deleting apps that nag them too much because the stress of the notification outweighs the benefit of the tool.

### 2. Potential Improvement for Focus Bear
* **Observation:** The transition between "Focus Mode" and "Break Mode" needs to be very clear but not jarring. 
* **Improvement:** We could implement a "soft start" or a visual countdown that isn't red/aggressive, helping the user transition their brain into a new task without a spike in anxiety.

### 3. Patient Communication Practice
**Scenario:** A user is frustrated because they keep "breaking" their focus habit and feels like the app is failing them.
**My Response:** "I hear how frustrating it is when you can't get into the flow you planned. Please know that the app is a tool to support you, not a judge of your productivity. If the current settings feel too restrictive, we can look at adjusting your 'block' levels to be a bit more flexible while you build up your routine. You haven't failed; you're just adjusting the system to fit your brain better."
