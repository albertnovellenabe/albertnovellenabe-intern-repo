# Professionalism & Communication Reflection

## My Approach to Teamwork
I’ve seen projects succeed because everyone felt safe enough to admit they were stuck. To me, great teamwork happens when there's no "ego." I plan to keep my communication clear by being direct but kind—no one likes a toxic dev, no matter how good their code is.

## Being Proactive & Meeting Prep
I won’t wait for a supervisor to tell me what to do every morning. If I finish a task, I’ll look at the backlog or research ways to optimize our current real-time tracking logic. For meetings, I’ll never show up empty-handed. I’ll have my notes ready, my questions listed, and a clear update on what I’ve accomplished.

## Communication & Escalation Strategy
I understand that everyone is busy, so I’ll use the "lightest touch" first:
1. **Low Urgency:** Email. I'll give it 48 hours.
2. **Medium Urgency:** Discord. If it’s a blocker for tomorrow’s task, I’ll ping there and expect a 24-hour turnaround.
3. **High Urgency:** SMS. If a link is dead or a meeting is starting now, I'll text.
4. **Emergency:** Call. Only if the "house is on fire."

If I don't get a response, I'll send a polite nudge. I'll only escalate to a higher level or a different person if a project-critical deadline is at risk and I've exhausted the appropriate channels.

## My "Never" List (Personal Boundaries)
* I won't sit around idle. If I'm stuck, I'll try to solve it for 30 minutes, then ask a peer, then go to my supervisor.
* I won't ask questions that a 10-second Google search could answer.
* I won't send vague calendar invites like "Meeting." I'll always include the project name and an agenda.
* I won't ignore feedback. If I'm told to change how I handle refresh tokens or state management, I'll make sure it's reflected in the next PR.

## Staying Accountable
I have noted the CEO's contact information from the onboarding deck. While I aim to solve issues at the team level, I know this is a safety net for major breaches of conduct or issues that threaten the integrity of the work environment.
