# Competitive Landscape: Focus Bear vs. The World

## Reflection

### What makes Focus Bear different?
Focus Bear is a "hybrid" that combines the best of both worlds. While **Freedom** just blocks sites and **Routinery** just tracks habits, Focus Bear does both. It doesn't just remind me to meditate; it actually locks my screen and *guides* me through the meditation while blocking the rest of the world out. It’s much more "hands-on" than the others.

### Why would I choose Focus Bear?
If I were a user, I'd choose Focus Bear because it reduces **decision fatigue**. With **Tiimo**, I still have to choose to follow the plan. With Focus Bear, the plan is enforced. For an ADHD brain that struggles with "task initiation," having the computer force the routine is a game-changer.

### What do others have that Focus Bear doesn't?
* **Tiimo** has an incredible "AI Task Breakdown" feature where you can type "Clean the kitchen" and it automatically generates sub-tasks (wash dishes, wipe counters, etc.). 
* **Freedom** feels a bit more "lightweight" and has a simpler UI for people who don't want a full routine and just want a quick 1-hour block.

### One improvement Focus Bear could make
Based on my research, Focus Bear could improve its **visual aesthetics and flexibility**. **Tiimo** won "App of the Year" because it is beautiful and non-judgmental. Sometimes Focus Bear can feel a bit "strict" or "technical." Making the UI more customizable with icons or "pops of joy" like Tiimo might make it more welcoming for neurodivergent users.
