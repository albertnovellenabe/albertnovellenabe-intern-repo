# stuff happened here

1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to experience the full lifecycle of a professional software product. Specifically, I’m eager to see how a remote team bridges the gap between high-level business goals (Entrepreneurship) and technical implementation. I hope to learn how Focus Bear maintains its codebase to support neurodivergent users, ensuring that every update is stable and truly helpful for executive function.

2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am most excited to take my Jetpack Compose and GraphQL skills from "project-ready" to "production-level." While I’ve built systems for real-time monitoring before, doing it at scale within a professional repository is a different challenge. I’m also looking forward to mastering Automated Testing (Unit and UI tests) to ensure the features I build are resilient.

3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I bring a strong foundation in building real-time, data-driven applications. My experience with Express.js, PostgreSQL, and secure OTP systems allows me to jump into backend and authentication tasks quickly. Additionally, my studies in Entrepreneurship give me a "product-first" mindset—I don’t just focus on writing code; I focus on how that code solves a specific pain point for the user.

4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I’d like to improve my technical communication and conflict resolution within a team setting. I’ve mostly worked on my own projects, so I want to get better at explaining my architectural choices during code reviews and learning how to handle differing technical opinions constructively and professionally.

5. What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success means shipping meaningful features—like improving a location-tracking module or a UI component—that directly benefit the Focus Bear community. On a personal level, success is becoming a more "self-led" engineer who can navigate a complex Kanban board and contribute high-quality, tested code that requires minimal revision.
