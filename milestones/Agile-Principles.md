# Milestone: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## Reflection

### Benefits and Challenges
To me, the biggest benefit of Agile is **visibility**. In traditional setups, you can hide behind a "working on it" status for weeks. In Agile, the board shows exactly where you are. The biggest challenge is the mental shift—it requires you to be okay with shipping a "good enough" feature now and improving it later, rather than waiting for it to be perfect.

### Applying Agile to My Role
Since I'm managing university deadlines and dev tasks, the principle of **"Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done"** is huge. It reminds me to build the most impactful version of a feature first (like a basic functioning OTP) before trying to add every possible bell and whistle.

### 1. Scrum vs. Kanban (My Words)
* **Scrum** is like a train schedule: if you miss the train (sprint planning), you have to wait for the next one. It's great for teams that need a lot of structure and have predictable workloads.
* **Kanban** is like a deli counter: you take a number and get served when the person at the front is done. It’s much better for our environment because it focuses on keeping the work moving constantly without the overhead of heavy planning meetings.

### 2. My "Most Useful" Principle
**Principle:** "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."
**Why:** As I build the real-time monitoring logic, I want to avoid "Dark Periods" where I’m coding for a week with nothing to show. I’ll aim to merge small, working pieces of logic into the repo every couple of days. This keeps the codebase healthy and ensures I'm getting feedback early.

## Verification
I have researched the Agile Manifesto and understand how Kanban supports Focus Bear's mission. I commit to being transparent with my progress and embracing change as a natural part of the development process.
